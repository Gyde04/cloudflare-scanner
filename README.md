# Cloudflare IP Scanner

A powerful web application designed to help security researchers and system administrators discover real IP addresses behind Cloudflare's protection. This tool employs multiple advanced techniques to attempt to reveal the actual server IP addresses that Cloudflare is protecting.

## üåü Key Features

- **DNS History Analysis**: Scans historical DNS records to find previously exposed IP addresses
- **SSL Certificate Information**: Extracts and analyzes SSL certificate data for potential IP leaks
- **WHOIS Data Lookup**: Retrieves and analyzes domain registration information
- **Subdomain Scanning**: Discovers and analyzes subdomains for potential IP leaks
- **User Agent Rotation**: Implements intelligent user agent rotation to avoid detection
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Robust error handling and retry mechanisms
- **Modern Web Interface**: Clean, responsive UI for easy interaction

## üîß Technical Details

- Built with Flask for robust web application handling
- Utilizes multiple Python libraries for comprehensive scanning:
  - `dnspython` for DNS operations
  - `cryptography` for SSL certificate analysis
  - `python-whois` for domain information
  - `requests` for HTTP operations
  - `beautifulsoup4` for HTML parsing
